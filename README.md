🔧 Electronics Toolkit
An offline-first, modern web-based toolkit for electronics engineers, hobbyists, and students. Whether you're breadboarding at midnight or designing a PCB under a deadline, this collection of calculators and utilities will make your workflow smoother.

💡 Built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript — no installations, no internet required, just open and go!

🧰 Features
Currently available tools:

Tool	Description
Ohm's Law Calculator	Quickly calculate Voltage, Current, Resistance, or Power from any two known values.
LED Resistor Calculator	Determine the correct series resistor for your LED, based on supply voltage, forward voltage, and current.
Feedback Resistor Calculator	Calculate feedback resistor pairs for op-amp gain configurations (inverting and non-inverting).

⚙️ Each tool features dynamic calculations that update in real time as you input values.

Contributions are welcome (see below)! 🎯

🧠 Why This Exists
There are plenty of calculators online, but most require internet access, suffer from bad UX, or bombard users with ads. This project aims to be:

Offline-friendly (just keep it on a flash drive!)

Lightweight

Fast and responsive

Visually clean and distraction-free

Perfect for labs, exams, or field work where internet is flaky.

🙌 Contributing
Pull requests are welcome! Here's how to get started:

Fork the repository.

Create a new branch: git checkout -b add-my-tool

Add your HTML/JS/CSS in the correct folders.

Add a link to your tool in index.html.

Submit a pull request and describe your addition!

See CONTRIBUTING.md (coming soon) for detailed guidelines.
